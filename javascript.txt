java is used to screate app while javascript is used with website which decide how it should behave on brower.
javascript became more useful when some pro wrote javascript engine inside c++ language now known as node.

*when writing code, write script inside body tag, as it helps javascript to render elements easily.
create new index.javascript file and write first javascript program
1. Variable = they are used to store a value in memory. 
    a. declaring variable = Usually we declare variable using 'var' keyword butits better to use 'let' to declare variable.
    b. naming a variable = it's best to give a meaningful name. Cameltoe method to name i.e = first name variable small and
    second one capital. e.g: firstName
    c. pass a value to that variable.
    d. to show that value in console use console.log().
2. Constant Identifier: they are used, When u don't want to change value of assigned variable.
    otherwise use 'let' variable to reassign variables.

    Dynamic Typing = when we can change value of variable in runtime.

3.Types of value which can be asssignned to a variable. 
    1. Primitive or Value types.
        a. string = a simple name or text type value.
        b. number = a numerical or decimal value.
        c. boolean =  true or false.
        d. undetified = when you don't assign any value to variable.
        e. null = when you want to clear value of variable/ or initialize that variable value from zero.

    2. Reference type
        a. Object : (literal defination = LD) : Object is collection of properties.
        My defination = MD : obeject is like real life object which have diffent features or style or thinking , all of 
        which is called properties.
        e.g:
        let person = {       //declaring object
        name: "jai",         //remember to put comma after declaring every value
        age : 31
        };
        
*Always put semicolon after declaring a variable, function, object and Arrays. otherwise it will show syntax error.

        There are 2 methods to access properties of object. 
        a. Dot method : we call object name and then add dot and call the properties, we want to change.
        e.g person.age = 20;
        b. Bracket method : object name + property we want to change or access in brackets.
        e.g person["age"] = 30;
        *Also we can pass the value to a variable and then call that variable to access that variable.
        e.g: let cat = 'age';
        person['cat'] = 29;

        b. Arrays : LD : Is is variable which store multiple values or large no of data.
        MD : It is collection of data.
        *We access data in array by index no.
        let Fruits = {'apple','grapes','banana','pineapple'}
        fruit[1] = 'jai';
        console.log(Fruits)

        c. Function : It is block of code which can be used anywhere in a whole program.
        MD : it is like big bank where you can store anything and get money/code whenever needed.
        syntax:
