 <b>Javascript Notes from mosh 1 hour crash course video</b>

Java language is used to create app while javascript is used to decide behaviour of website on browser.
Javascript became more useful when some pro wrote javascript engine inside c++ language and now known as node.

*when writing code, write script inside body tag, as it helps javascript to render elements easily.

Create new index.javascript file and write first javascript program
Press ctrl+~ and open terminal. press ls to print all files. To run javascript file write node + javascript file name
and press enter.

1. Variable = they are used to store a value in memory. 
    a. declaring variable = Usually we declare variable using 'var' keyword butits better to use 'let' to declare variable.
    b. naming a variable = it's best to give a meaningful name. Cameltoe method to name i.e = first name variable small and
    second one capital. e.g: firstName
    c. pass a value to that variable.
    d. to show that value in console use console.log().
2. Constant Identifier: they are used, When u don't want to change value of assigned variable.
    otherwise use 'let' variable to reassign variables.

*Dynamic Typing = when we can change value of variable in runtime.

3.Types of value which can be asssignned to a variable. 
    1. Primitive or Value types.
        a. string = a simple name or text type value.
        b. number = a numerical or decimal value.
        c. boolean =  true or false.
        d. undetified = when you don't assign any value to variable.
        e. null = when you want to clear value of variable/ or initialize that variable value from zero.

    2. Reference type
        a. Object : (literal defination = LD) : Object is collection of properties.
        My defination = MD : obeject is like real life object which have diffent features or style or thinking , all of 
        which is called properties.
        e.g:
        let person = {       //declaring object
        name: "jai",         //remember to put comma after declaring every value
        age : 31
        };
        
*Always put semicolon after declaring a variable, function, object and Arrays. otherwise it will show syntax error.

        There are 2 methods to access properties of object. 
        a. Dot method : we call object name and then add dot and call the properties, we want to change.
        e.g person.age = 20;
        b. Bracket method : object name + property we want to change or access in brackets.
        e.g person["age"] = 30;
        *Also we can pass the value to a variable and then call that variable to access that variable.
        e.g: let cat = 'age';
        person['cat'] = 29;

        b. Arrays : LD : Is is variable which store multiple values or it is data structure which represents list of items.
        MD : It is collection of data and it can store any type of data i.e string or number.
            *We access data in array by index no.
        let Fruits = {'apple','grapes','banana','pineapple'}
        fruit[1] = 'jai';
        console.log(Fruits)

        c. Function : It is block of code  or set of statements which perform a task or calculate value.
        MD : it is like big bank where you can store anything/set certain tasks and get task/code whenever needed.
        syntax: start with keyword function + name of function + () to declare it and then write code in the body {}.
        parameter: its variable which is declared in parenthesis at top, a function can have many parameter.  
        argument: its value we pass while calling that funtion at end.
        return is used to return value when that argument is called.
