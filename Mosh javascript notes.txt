 <b>Javascript Notes from mosh 1 hour crash course video</b>

Java language is used to create app while javascript is used to decide behaviour of website on browser.
Javascript became more useful when some pro wrote javascript engine inside c++ language and now known as node.
node is basically javascript runtime and  runs javascript v8 engine.

*when writing code, write script inside body tag, as it helps javascript to render elements easily.

Create new index.javascript file and write first javascript program
Press ctrl+~ to open terminal. write command ls to print all files. To run javascript file write node + javascript
file name and press enter.

1. Variable = they are used to store a value in memory. 
    a. Declaring variable = we can declare variable in 3 ways : 
        'let' is most commonly used .
        'var' = variable keyword is used to assign value which can be ressigned again in code.
        'Const' : Constants are used, When u don't want to change value of assigned variable, its best to use when 
        you are writing long codes.
    b. naming a variable = it's best to give a meaningful name. Cameltoe method to name i.e = first name 
    variable small and second one capital. e.g: firstName
    c. pass any type of value to that variable like number, string or float.
        to show that value in console use console.log().

*Dynamic Typing = when we can change value of variable in runtime.

3.Types of value which can be asssignned to a variable. 
(i). Primitive or Value types.
    a. string = a simple name or text type value.
    b. number = a numerical or decimal value.
    c. boolean =  true or false.
    d. unidentified = when you don't assign any value to variable.
    e. null = when you want to clear value of variable/ or initialize that variable value from zero.

(ii). Reference type
    1. Object : (literal defination = LD) : Object is collection of properties.
    My defination = MD : object is like real life object which have diffent features or style or thinking ,
        all of which is called properties.
    e.g:
    let person = {       //declaring object
    name: "jai",         //remember to put comma after declaring every value
    age : 31
    };
    
*Always put semicolon after declaring a variable, function, object and Arrays. otherwise it will show syntax error.

    There are 2 methods to access properties of object. 
    (a) Dot method : we call object name + add dot + call the properties.
    e.g person.age = 20;
    (b) Bracket method : object name + property we want to change or access in brackets.
    e.g person["age"] = 30;
    *Also we can pass the value to a variable and then call that variable to access that variable.
    e.g: let cat = 'age';
    person['cat'] = 29;

    2. Arrays : LD : Is is variable which store multiple values or it is data structure which represents 
    list of items.
    MD : It is collection of data and it can store any type of data i.e string or number.
        *We access data in array by index no.
    let Fruits = {'apple','grapes','banana','pineapple'}
    fruit[1] = 'jai';
    console.log(Fruits)

    3. Function : It is block of code or set of statements which perform a task or calculate value.
    MD : it is like big bank where you can store anything/set certain tasks and get task/code whenever needed.
    syntax: start with keyword function + name of function + () to declare it and then write code in the body {}.

    parameter: its variable which is declared in parenthesis at top, a function can have many parameter.  
    
    argument: its value we pass while calling that funtion at end.
    
    return is used to return value when that argument is called. 
    once return is called, no code is gonna works after that.

*we can use console.table to print values of object in a tabular form.
